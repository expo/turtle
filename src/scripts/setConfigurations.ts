// Turtle before doing anything (and after every build) checks for the first config
// (an element in config table with key=i) that is not taken (config.i is null/outdated)
// or is taken by this process itself.
// If Turtle dies unexpectedly the configuration will become free after TTL expires,
// so the state (number of HP/NP turtles) should come back to normal soon.

// For example, if a configuration table looks like this:
// [ HIGH_CONFIGURATION, NORMAL_CONFIGURATION, HIGH_CONFIGURATION ]
// If there is one turtle it runs with High Priority first.
// If there are two turtles, one runs with High Priority first, the second one with Normal Priority first.
// If the first dies, and the third is started in his place, it gets 3rd config (again HP-first),
// but after some time, because of TTL for config reservations,
// they should come back to using configurations no. 1 and 2.
// If there are no more available configurations from the table, the default configuration is used.

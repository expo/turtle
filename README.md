<hr />

 > ðŸš¨ This tool is specifically intended for the classic build service. We recommend [migrating to EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/migrating/), which [also supports building on your own infrastructure](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/local-builds/). The final Expo SDK release to support Turtle was SDK 46.

Turtle CLI is a command line interface for building Expo standalone apps. You can use it both on your CI and your private computer.
